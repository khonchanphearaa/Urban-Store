    SMIP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)

        The standard internet protocol used for sending and transferring email messages between servers, 
    acting as a digital post office for outgoing mail. It relies on TCP for reliable delivery 
    and uses ports 587 or 465 for client submission, while IMAP/POP3 are used for receiving. 

    - Security: Modern SMTP supports encryption via TLS to protect email transmission.

    Key Point:
        - Port 587/465: Used by mail client (like Outlook/Gmail) to submit outgoing 
        - Port 25: Generally used for server-to-server relaying.
