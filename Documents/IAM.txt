++IAM: The The industry-standard name for the group managing user identities, 
  authentication (logging in), and authorization (permissions).


    HOW to get: credentials
    
    *Note you can't just use regular Gemail Password. Google blocks (less secure app)
    for security you must generate a spacific (App Password).

    STEP 1: Setup 2-Step Verification
    Google requires 2-Step Verification to be active before you can create an App Password.
        
        1. Go to your https://myaccount.google.com
        2. On left select Security
        3. Under "How you sign in to Google," click on 2-Step Verification.
        4. Follow the prompts to turn it on


    STEP 2: Generate the App Password
    Once 2-Step Verification is active, you can create the specific code for your Node.js app.

        1. Search (App Password) 
        2. Give it a name so you remember what it's for (e.g., "ThebanAuthApp").
        3. A window will pop up with a 16-character code (e.g., abcd efgh ijkl mnop)
    

    STEP 3: In .env
    Copy that 16-character code and paste it into your project. Do not include spaces.
   
        EMAIL_USER=yourname@gmail.com
        EMAIL_PASS=abcdefghijklmnop

**Important Note: Treat this EMAIL_PASS exactly like your main password. If you ever push your code to GitHub, make sure your .env file is listed in .gitignore so your password doesn't become public.
