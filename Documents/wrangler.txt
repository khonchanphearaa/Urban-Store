    Wrangler 
        Deploy Cloudlare Workers project, The wrangler.toml file is the identify and instruction
    manual for your applications. It tell cloudlare who your Workers is and how it should behave.

    + The Purpose: By setting a specific date, you are telling Cloudflare: "Please run my code using the rules and features that were stable on January 1st, 2024."
    + Why it matters: If Cloudflare introduces a "breaking change" tomorrow (in 2026), your Worker won't break because it is safely locked to the 2024 behavior.
    + When to change it: You only update this date when you want to use a new Cloudflare feature that was released after that date.
