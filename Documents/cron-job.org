    Cron-Job.org

        On Render's Free Tier, services automatically "spin down" (go to sleep) after 15 minutes 
    of inactivity. When a customer tries to pay and the service is sleeping, it takes about 1 minute 
    to "wake up," which can cause timeouts or a bad user experience.

    To keep your service awake 24/7 for free, you can use an external (Cron-Job.org) to "ping" 
    your URL every few minutes so Render thinks there is active traffic.


    ⚠️ Important: The 750-Hour Limit
        Beause in e-commerce-api is have 2 service deploy, I just keep running awake 1 service product-api (Node.js)
    - Render gives you 750 free hours per month.
    - A month has 744 hours.
    - If you keep one service awake 24/7, you use 744 hours (You are safe!).
    - If you keep two services (Node + Python) awake 24/7, you use 1,488 hours.

        **How to calculate your "Free Hours"Remember the math for your two services (Node.js + Python):
        1 Service awake 24/7: $\approx 744$ hours/month (Safe)
        2 Services awake 24/7: $\approx 1,488$ hours/month (Over Limit)

    
    1.SETUP How to keep it running forever without it being disabled
        To prevent the "15 failures" rule from disabling your job, make sure your /ping route is as "light" as possible.

        app.js OR index.js for root node that make sure is running services

        app.get('/ping', (req, res) => {
            res.status(200).send('pong');
        });

    
    2.SETUP Config Cron-job.org
        1. Log in to cron-job.org.
        2. Create Cronjob:
            + Title: Urban Store Node Awake
            + Address: https://your-node-service.onrender.com/ping      <-- This baseUrls that you want to awak cron-jon.org
            + Schedule: Select User-defined and enter: */14 * * * *
            + Method: GET
            + Save
