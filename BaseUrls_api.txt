## Decoupled architecture 
    ``` Base URLs ```serve as the foundational address that allow your Fronted
    Node.js Backend, and Python Service to talk to each other.

Deployed on (Render), URLs will change from [localhost] to production grade HTTPs links.

1. The Fronted Base URLs (Client-Side)
This is what user sees in theri. It communications with your Node.js API
    @@ Production: https://urban-store-6gj1.onrender.com
    @@ Purpose: Used by the fronted (React/Vue/Mobile) to send login credentials, fetch products, and submit orders.

2. The Node.js API Base URL (Server-Side)
If your backend is hosted separately or under a specific route, this is the root for all business logic.

3. The Python Service Base URL (Decoupled architecture )
This is a private or internal URL. Your frontend usually never talks to this directly. Only your Node.js server talks to it.
    @@ production: https://bakong-service-xxx.onrender.com
    @@ Purpose: Handles KHQR generation and Bakong blockchain verification.

4. Configuration in Code
To keep your project flexible, you should never "hard-code" these URLs. Instead, use your (.env) files

    In (production-api/src/config/bakong.js)
    @@This tells Node.js where the python service lives
