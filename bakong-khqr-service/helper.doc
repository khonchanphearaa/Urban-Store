+++ Here is the step-by-step guide to installing these libraries. +++

+ Known About create and Active a Virtual Environment

    python -m venv venv                 ### Run the following command. This creates a new subfolder (commonly named .venv or venv) 
                                            that contains a self-contained Python installation.
    
    venv\Scripts\activate               ### To start using this isolated environment, you must "activate" 
                                            it so your terminal knows to use the local Python version and not the system-wide one. 


1. CREATE and Active a Virtual Environment
Open your terminal in your project folder and run:

    cd path/to/your/project_folder

macOS/Linux:
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

2. INSTALL the Libraries
You can install all of them at once using pip. Copy and paste this command:

    pip install fastapi uvicorn python-dotenv bakong-khqr pydantic qrcode pillow jinja2 python-multipart requests

3. SAVE Your Dependencies
Once installed, it is important to create a requirements.txt file. 
This allows others (or your production server) to install the exact same versions later.

    pip freeze > requirements.txt

4.RUNNING Python
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 5001
